* Generate anagrams which do not produce words
    * Pass the context to apply(), but add a default method which just uses it as a filter
    * For anagrams, implement apply() with context so that we can generate all matching anagrams for the given context

* More substring wordplay types

* Multiple hypernyms when pre-processing WordNet data
